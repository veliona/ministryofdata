      "A droid is a fictional robot possessing some degree of artificial intelligence in the Star Wars science fiction franchise. Coined by special effects artist John Stears, the term is a clipped form of \"android\",[1] a word originally reserved for robots designed to look and act like a human.[2] The word \"droid\" has been a registered trademark of Lucasfilm Ltd since 1977.[3][4][5][6]"
