      "R2-D2 is a fictional robot character in the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas, who appears in the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy, the sequel trilogy, and Rogue One. A small astromech droid, R2-D2 is a major character and appears in all Star Wars films to date. Throughout the course of the films, he joins or supports Padm√© Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi in various points in the saga.",
      "English actor Kenny Baker played R2-D2 in all three original Star Wars films, and received billing credit for the character in the prequel trilogy, where Baker's role was reduced, as R2-D2 was portrayed mainly by radio controlled props and CGI models. In the sequel trilogy, Baker was credited as consultant for The Force Awakens, however Jimmy Vee also co-performed the character in some scenes. Vee later took over the role beginning in The Last Jedi.[1] R2-D2's sounds and vocal effects were created by Ben Burtt. R2-D2 was designed in artwork by Ralph McQuarrie, co-developed by John Stears and built by Tony Dyson."
